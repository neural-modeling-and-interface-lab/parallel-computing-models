This example dataset was recorded from one rat performing Delayed-NonMatch-to-Sample memory task.  

Each DNMS trial started with the Sample Phase when the animal was presented randomly with one of the two levers (Left or Right) on one wall of the chamber.  
The animal was trained to press the lever to generate a Sample Response event.  The lever was then retracted, and the Delay Phase with a random duration (5-30 sec) started.  
For the delay duration, the animal was required to nose-poke into a lighted device on the opposite wall.  
When the delay ended, the nose-poke light was turned off; both levers were extended, and the animal was required to press the lever opposite to the lever it pressed during the Sample Phase and generated a Nonmatch Response.  
If the correct lever was pressed, the animal was rewarded with a drop of water.  

One session had 80-120 DNMS trials. 

Spatio-temporal patterns of CA3 spikes around (-2 sec to 2 sec) Sample Response events were used as model inputs.  
Spatio-temporal patterns of CA1 spikes around (-2 sec to 2 sec) Sample Response events were used as model outputs.
