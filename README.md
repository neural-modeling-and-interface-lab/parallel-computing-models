For the publication of JNEUMETH-D-21-000565

This repository contains the implementation of parallelization strategy of two input-output models (i.e., multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model, and memory decoding (MD) model) in their corresponding sub-folder.

Both model can be run locally with PC's cpu cores or on hpc cluster with hundreds of computing nodes.  Both MIMO and MD model uses the default parallelization strategy described in the paper.  Users can extend and implement their own parallelization strategy based on the current code.  

In addition to the code of MIMO & MD model as well as the parallelization strategy, we also provide two example datasets.  These two datasets are for testing the model and parallelization strategy only.  Please do not distribute the datasets without the permission of the authors. 

Data of the human studies mentioned in the paper are available to readers upon request.
