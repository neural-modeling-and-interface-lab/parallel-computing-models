For the publication of JNEUMETH-D-21-000565

This repository contains the implementation of the parallelization strategy of two input-output models (i.e., multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model and memory decoding (MD) model) in their corresponding sub-folder.

Both models can be run locally with PC's CPU cores or on the HPC cluster with hundreds of computing nodes. Both MIMO and MD model uses the default parallelization strategy described in the paper.

Users can use the parallelization schemes as templates and implement their own parallelization strategy according to their specific modeling procedure.

In addition to the code of the MIMO & MD model as well as the parallelization strategy, we also provide two example datasets. These two datasets are for testing the model and parallelization strategy only. Please do not distribute the datasets without the permission of the authors.

Data of the human studies mentioned in the paper are available to readers upon request.
